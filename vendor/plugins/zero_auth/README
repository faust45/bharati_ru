Simple Rails Auth.

User model required fields: 
  (login, password, salt, security_token, security_token_expiry, verified)

By default all actions is login_required,
  to cancel this behavior use free_actions(:login, :show, :list)

How we can know user logged_in or not?
  ask current_user.logged_in? or current_user.anonymous? 

We want get all registered users which already activat account:
  User.active
